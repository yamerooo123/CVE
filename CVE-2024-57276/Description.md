The DAUpdaterSVC service in Dragon Age Origins is vulnerable to an unquoted service path vulnerability. This service is configured with
insecure permissions, allowing any local user to modify the executable
file path used by the service. The service runs with NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, enabling attackers to escalate privileges
by replacing or placing a malicious executable in the service path.
When the service is started or restarted, the malicious executable will
run with full system privileges, allowing full compromise of the
system. The vulnerability affects all systems where Dragon Age Origins
and the DAUpdaterSVC service are installed, and the service path has
not been properly quoted.

[Attack Vectors]

To exploit this vulnerability:

Local Access: An attacker must have local access to the system where Dragon Age Origins and the DAUpdaterSVC service is installed .

Modify the Service Path: Since the executable file path of the DAUpdaterSVC service is unquoted and allows all users full access, an attacker can replace or inject a malicious executable into the service path.

Trigger the Service: The attacker must then start or restart the DAUpdaterSVC service, which will execute the malicious file with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, leading to full control over the system.
