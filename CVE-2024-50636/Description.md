 PyMOL 2.5.0 contains a vulnerability in its "Run Script" function,
 which allows the execution of arbitrary Python code embedded within
 .PYM files. Attackers can craft a malicious .PYM file containing a
Python reverse shell payload and exploit the function to achieve Remote
Command Execution (RCE). This vulnerability arises because PyMOL treats
 .PYM files as Python scripts without properly validating or restricting
the commands within the script, enabling attackers to run unauthorized
 commands in the context of the user running the application.

[VulnerabilityType Other]

Remote Command Execution

[Vendor of Product]

Schrodinger\PyMOL

[Affected Product Code Base]

PyMOL - 2.5.0

[Affected Component]

The vulnerability is affected the Run Script function.

[Attack Type]

Remote

[Impact Code execution]

true

[Impact Information Disclosure]

true

[Attack Vectors]

To exploit the vulnerability, attackers must create a file with a .PYM extension. The .PYM file is treated as a Python script, allowing attackers to embed a Python reverse shell payload. By using the 'Run Script' function, they can execute the payload and achieve Remote Command Execution.
